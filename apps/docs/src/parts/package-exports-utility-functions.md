## Exported Utility Functions

The following demonstrates how to import all of the VPIC utility functions from this package.

::: tip :bulb: TIP
Although they are all imported at once in this example, you should import only the functions you are
using.
:::

```javascript
import {
  isValidVin, // function for offline VIN validation
  useNHTSA, // composable function returning helper functions for the VPIC API
} from '@shaggytools/nhtsa-api-wrapper'
```
